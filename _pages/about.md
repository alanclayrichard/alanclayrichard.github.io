## Hello!

I am Clay, a soon-to-be Ph.D. graduate in Chemical Engineering from Auburn University with a passion for advancing the frontiers of protein engineering and biomolecular design. As I approach this transition in my academic journey, I'm actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to apply my expertise in computational protein design to solve real-world challenges.

## About me

My research journey has cultivated a deep fascination with the intersection of chemical engineering principles and protein science. Throughout my doctoral studies, I've developed specialized skills in protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, and the rational design of novel protein functionalities. I thrive in collaborative environments where multidisciplinary perspectives converge to address complex biological problems.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on leveraging computational tools and experimental validation to create proteins with enhanced or novel functions. I'm particularly interested in:

- The interface between physics and AI/ML techniques
- Computational protein design algorithms
- Biomolecular recognition for engineering/therapeutic/diagnostic applications
- Protein-protein interaction networks
- Translating fundamental science into solutions for real-world problems

## Professional Aspirations

As I transition from academia to the next phase of my career, I'm enthusiastic about opportunities in:

- Research and development roles in biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies
- Positions applying computational methods to engineering challenges
- Collaborative teams working at the interface of computation and experimentation
- Organizations committed to translating protein engineering innovations into impactful applications
- Adjacent fields that apply fundamental engineering principles to fun problems

I welcome conversations about how my expertise in protein design could contribute to your organization's mission. Please feel free to reach out via the contact information provided.
